The research described in Chapter \ref{chap:jtd_tismir} was completed with assistance from undergraduate student interns Joshua Schlichting and Tessa Pastor, who I was responsible for supervising alongside Peter Harrison. Joshua and Tessa assisted in identifying recordings that met \replaced[id=HC]{the}{an} inclusion criteria defined \replaced[id=HC]{in }{by myself (}Section \ref{sec:jtd_inclusion_criteria}\deleted[id=HC]{)}. They each also contributed three of the annotation files used for evaluating the automated system (Section \ref{sec:jtd_validation}).

An early version of the methods described in Section \ref{sec:rsi_handcrafted_methods} were used in an undergraduate dissertation submitted by Reuben Bance to the Faculty of Music, University of Cambridge, in Summer 2024. I was responsible for supervising Reuben's work, alongside Peter Harrison, and developed these methods in collaboration with him. These methods were subsequently refined for inclusion in Chapter \ref{chap:xai_rsi} by myself, and I am otherwise responsible for the entirety of the modelling and analysis conducted in this chapter. 

The experiments described in Section \ref{sec:mp_methods} received ethical approval from the Ethics Review Committee at the Faculty of Music, University of Cambridge (reference number: 21-22-163). The experiment described in Section \ref{sec:gen_subjective_evaluation} received approval from the same committee (reference number: 2025-015).
