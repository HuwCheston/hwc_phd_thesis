%% Abstract:
%%
\abstract{%
    Improvisation is part of many musical traditions, with jazz perhaps one of the most diverse to have emerged in the past century. Through improvisation, jazz musicians manipulate many aspects of the music they play, including the harmony, melody, and rhythm of an underlying composition. These widespread freedoms render the computational modelling of jazz improvisation a challenging task within Music Information Retrieval research, both due to a lack of available data and a difficulty in generating models that can capture the complexity of this music while remaining interpretable. Here we detail computational studies of three core dimensions of jazz improvisation: musical style, rhythm, and ensemble interaction. Through these studies we examine long-standing issues in Music Information Retrieval and the wider digital humanities, including automatic performer identification and model interpretation. The goal of this research is not only to advance the state-of-the-art in symbolic music modelling, but generate human-friendly explanations of supervised learning models that allow us to learn more about the ways in which a highly complex form of art is produced. This thesis is accompanied by a novel, open source dataset of hundreds of hours of jazz audio recordings annotated by an automated signal processing pipeline and numerous interactive web applications, which we hope will support future computational research into the nature and practice of musical improvisation --- both in jazz, and beyond.
