\chapter{Introduction}
This document was created with the help of a custom class file~\cite{example}. A
{\em \LaTeX{} class file}\index{\LaTeX{} class file@LaTeX class file} is a file,
which holds style information for a particular \LaTeX{} class\footnote{You can
find more about classes at \url{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/clsguide}.}.

There are some handy options for citing publications. It is possible to print just the year of some publication:~\citeyear{example}. It is also possible to print the name of the author(s) in the form ``Author et al.'': \citeauthor{example}. Finally, there is also a command to print the full list of authors of a publication: \citet*{example}.

This is an example glossary reference: . \\
